# Uber_Analysis
This project involved a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Uber ride requests
to uncover patterns, operational bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities. The key steps
carried out include:
 1. Data Loading & Understanding
* Loaded the cleaned Uber dataset from Excel.
* Examined column types, data structure, and overall completeness.
* Summarized numerical and categorical features using statistical methods.
 2. Univariate & Bivariate Analysis
* Analyzed ride demand patterns by hour, revealing peak periods.
* Identified when ride requests went unfulfilled, categorizing by status (Cancelled, No
Cars Available).
* Compared trip outcomes by pickup location (City vs Airport)
 3. Trip Duration Insights
* Visualized the distribution of trip durations, discovering most trips are of 30–70 mins.
* Categorized trips into Short, Medium, Long, and Very Long for targeted analysis.
 4. Visualizations
Created 5 meaningful and professional charts:
1. Ride Demand by Hour
2. Unfulfilled Requests by Hour
3. Trip Status by Pickup Point
4. Trip Duration Distribution
5. Trip Category vs Pickup Point
 5. Advanced Analysis
* Integrated a time series forecast model to predict future ride demand.
* Proposed logic for driver allocation optimization based on pickup location and trip
category.
6. Conclusion & Recommendations
* Summarized major findings around demand trends, service failures, and trip patterns.
*  Provided data-driven recommendations to optimize driver availability, reduce
cancellations, and improve operational efficiency.
  This structured analysis not only reveals core inefficiencies in Uber’s current ride request
  system but also provides actionable insights to enhance reliability and customer satisfaction
  using data science techniques.
